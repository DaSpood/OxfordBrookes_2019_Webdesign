# OxfordBrookes_2019_Webdesign

This repository is an archive of a webdesign project for a course at Oxford Brookes University during the winter 2019 semester. This was also my first real experience with frontend web development.

The project subject went as follows:

---

Design a website for a fictional company wishing to sell their products. The website should have the following features:
- A home page
- A products page listing all available products
- Individual pages for different products
- An about page
- A contact page with a contact form
- Two different stylesheets (one 'normal', one for a special event/season)

---

The goal was to showcase our understanding of basic web design, accessibility issues, and basic scripting.

The project is being moved here in order to free the github-pages repository.
